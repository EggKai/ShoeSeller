        <h2>2. System Design</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The ShoeSeller website is built using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This approach
            segregates data (Model), presentation (View), and user input (Controller), which leads to better code
            organization, easier maintenance, and enhanced scalability. Each component is designed to interact
            seamlessly:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Manages the data and business logic, handling database interactions (MySQL)
                and operations such as user authentication, product catalog management, and order processing.</li>
            <li><strong>View:</strong> Responsible for rendering the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                ensuring that the site is responsive and user-friendly across devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Acts as the intermediary that processes user requests, manipulates data via Models,
                and sends the appropriate View to the client.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2 Features (System Design)</h3>
        <p>
            The website supports a multi-role system:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Full control over product management, user accounts, orders, discounts, and reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Employee:</strong> Ability to manage orders, update product listings, and handle customer support tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>User:</strong> Seamless browsing, personalized account management, secure checkout, and interactive product reviews.</li>
        </ul>
