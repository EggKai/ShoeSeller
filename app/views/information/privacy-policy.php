Data relating to consumption and preferences may be collected not only by tracking purchases made both on the Site and in Shoeseller’s physical shops, but also through the user’s iteration with Shoeseller and any information that the user voluntarily provides.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="privacy5" class="toggle_content">
            <p>Personal data collected through the Site are processed using mainly computerised and telematic methods and tools, adopting the necessary security measures to minimise the risks of destruction or loss, even accidental, of the data themselves, of unauthorised access or processing that is not permitted or does not comply with the purposes of collection as indicated in this Privacy Policy</p>
            <p>However, such measures, due to the nature of the online transmission medium, cannot absolutely limit or exclude any risk of unauthorised access or dispersion of data. To this end, it is advisable to periodically check that the computer is equipped with appropriate software devices for the protection of network data transmission, both incoming and outgoing (such as up-to-date antivirus systems) and that the Internet service provider has taken appropriate measures for the security of network data transmission (such as, for example, firewalls and spam filters).</p>

            <h5>COMPULSORY OR OPTIONAL NATURE OF PROVIDING PERSONAL DATA</h5>

        </div>
        <div id="privacy6" class="toggle_content">
            <p>With the exception of browsing data (the provision and collection of which is regulated by the cookie policy), the provision to Shoeseller of the data collected through the Site both to respond to users’ queries and requests and for marketing purposes, to study consumer habits and preferences, as well as for communication to the companies of SIT Singapore is free and optional. Failure to provide data does not restrict your use of the Site, but may make it impossible for Shoeseller to respond to your requests for information or assistance or to send you updates and communications about products, sales, promotional campaigns, events and other initiatives promoted by Shoeseller.</p>
            <p>The provision of personal data, in particular personal data, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number and bank details (in the case of payment by credit card) requested in the purchase form, is necessary for the signing of the contract for the purchase of products through the Site. Failure to provide such data may therefore make it impossible to conclude the purchase via the Site.</p>
            <p>In addition, the provision of certain personal data may be necessary for the provision of other services on the Site and related to the sale or to comply with obligations arising from laws or regulations (e.g. anti-money laundering legislation). Therefore, failure to provide such data may constitute, as the case may be, a legitimate and justified reason for not performing the purchase contract or the provision of related services.</p>
            <p>Where necessary, the compulsory or optional nature of the communication of data will be indicated from time to time, by appending an appropriate character (*) to the information required for the provision of services and the purchase of products on the Site. Failure to provide personal data indicated as optional will not result in any restriction or disadvantage to the user.</p>
