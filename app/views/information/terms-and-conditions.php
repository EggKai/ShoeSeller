    <ol>
       <li> 1.1     These general terms and conditions of sale (the “General Terms and Conditions”) apply to all sales contracts entered into between ShoeSeller Operating S.r.l., with registered office in via Turati, 12, Milan, 20121 (MI), VAT No. 08436950961, registered in the Companies Registry of Milan under No. 2026193, subject to the management and coordination of New Guards Group Holding S.p.A. (“ShoeSeller” or the “Company”) and the customer, identified as a consumer under the applicable consumer legislation (the “Customer”). ShoeSeller and the Customer are hereinafter jointly referred to as the “Parties” and individually as “Party”.</li>

       <li> 1.2     The Customer must read carefully and accept (by clicking on the appropriate flag in the shopping cart checkout phase) these General Terms and Conditions. By accepting the General Terms and Conditions, the Customer undertakes to comply with their provisions. If the Customer does not accept the General Terms and Conditions, they may not purchase “ShoeSeller” branded products. Therefore, the Customer is invited to print and save a copy of the General Terms and Conditions for future reference.</li>

       <li>1.3     ShoeSeller is part of the Farfetch group (a SG platform active in online sales of fashion, luxury and design goods, “Farfetch”): as better described below, Farfetch manages certain services on behalf of ShoeSeller which are connected to the purchase of “ShoeSeller” branded products and, specifically, payment processing and invoicing, product delivery services and an after-sales assistance service to Customers. The after-sales service will be managed by Farfetch and may be provided to the Customer also in a language other than that of the country in which the consumer resides or of which they are a citizen (such as, for example, English).</li>

       <li>1.4     The General Terms and Conditions govern the manner in which the Company sells “ShoeSeller” branded products (as well as any digital content and/or services, the “Products”) via the e-commerce website www.ShoeSeller.com(the “Website”).</li>

       <li>1.5     The General Terms and Conditions do not govern the provision of services or the sale of products by parties other than ShoeSeller and Farfetch, even if they are present on the Website through links, banners or other hypertext links.</li>

       <li>1.6     ShoeSeller can always be contacted at ecommerce@ShoeSeller.com and on +44 808 196 1114.</li>

       <li>1.7     Purchasing Products through the Website is strictly reserved for persons who: </li>

        <li>(i)    have legal capacity and have reached the legal age in their country of residence; and</li>

        <li>(ii)   purchase the Products for personal use and not for purposes related to commercial, business or professional activities.</li>

        <li>1.8     ShoeSeller will not accept and/or process orders from channels other than the Website or from persons who do not meet the requirements set out in the above paragraph. </li>

    <h2> 2. CONCLUSION OF THE AGREEMENT</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="section2" class="content">
    <ol>
       <li> 2.1     The sending of a purchase order by the Customer (the “Order”) constitutes acceptance of the offer to the public made by ShoeSeller through the Website, and, therefore, receipt of the Order by the Company constitutes the conclusion of a binding sales contract with respect to the Products selected by the Customer, which shall be entirely governed by the General Terms and Conditions in force at the time of its conclusion (the “Agreement”).</li>
       <li> 2.2     Before confirming and sending the Order, the Customer must therefore check the summary to ensure that the Products selected and all data provided are correct (for example the Customer may change the quantity of Products that they intend to purchase by adding or removing one or more of them from the virtual shopping cart). </li>
        <li>2.3     Once the Order has been received, ShoeSeller sends the Customer an e-mail confirming receipt of the Order, containing the number and details of the Order made (“Order Confirmation”). </li>
        <li>2.4     Subsequently, ShoeSeller will confirm to the Customer that the Order is being shipped (“Shipment Confirmation”), with different timing depending on the type of shipment that the Customer has selected.</li> 
       <li> 2.5     The Customer must keep the order number on the Order Confirmation to access the after-sales assistance service and for any other communications with the Company.</li>

    <h2> 3. PRODUCT AVAILABILITY</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="section3" class="content">
    <ol>
        <li>3.1     The Customer may purchase a maximum number of 3 (three) items of the same measure/size per Product.</li>
        <li>3.2     ShoeSeller constantly monitors and updates the stock availability of the Products displayed on the Website. Nevertheless, since the Website may be visited simultaneously by various Customers, it is possible that more than one Customer intend to purchase or purchase the same Product at the same time. In such cases, the Product may result to be available for a short time, while actually out of stock or no longer available. If a Product is unavailable for these reasons or in other cases of unavailability, ShoeSeller shall contact the Customer promptly and in any event within 5 (five) business days at the contact details provided by the Customer. </li>

    <h2> 4. PURCHASE PROCEDURE</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="section4" class="content">
    <ol>
        <li>4.1     To purchase a Product through the Website, the Customer may create and/or access their account through the reserved area on the Website or place the Order as a guest without creating an account (“guest” mode). If the Customer makes a “guest” purchase, the Customer must correctly fill in the fields of the relevant form on the Website, entering all the data required therein (e.g. first name, last name, billing and delivery address, e-mail address and telephone number) necessary to perform the Agreement.</li>
        <li>4.2     The description and essential characteristics of the Products, including details and composition, fit, colours and sizes (where applicable) are presented on the Website within each product sheet together with one or more photographic images in digital format. Although ShoeSeller takes measures to ensure that the photographs shown on the Website are faithful reproductions of the original products, the images and colours of the Products offered for sale on the Website may not be perfectly representative of their real characteristics due to the browser and/or devices used to access the Website. ShoeSeller is not, therefore, liable for any inconsistency of the graphic representations of the Products shown on the Website if due to the above technical reasons.</li>
        <li>4.3     Without prejudice to Orders already sent and/or Agreements already entered into, ShoeSeller reserves the right to remove any Product from the Website at any time, for commercial reasons relating to the seasonality of the products. </li>
        <li>4.4     To send an Order, the Customer selects the Products they are interested in on the Website and places them in the virtual shopping cart.</li>
        <li>4.5     Before completing the purchase, the Customer must check that the contents of the shopping cart are correct and enter any promotional code in the appropriate section. The promotional code, if valid, will be immediately applied to the amount displayed in the shopping cart. The Customer will then be asked to select the payment method, indicate the billing address, select the chosen shipping method and specify the shipping address if different from the billing address.</li>
        <li>4.6     By placing the Order - after accepting the General Terms and Conditions - and clicking on “pay now”, the Customer expressly acknowledges and accepts the payment obligation. Therefore, after placing the Order, the price of the Product will be charged to the Customer through the payment method selected by the Customer.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="dropdown" onclick="toggleDropdown('section5', this)">
    <h2> 5. PRICE AND PAYMENT METHOD</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="section5" class="content">
    <ol>
        <li>5.1     The price of the Products indicated on the Website (the “Price”), expressed in Euros or in other local currency that may be applicable, is inclusive of all applicable taxes and charges. Shipping costs are also included in the Price, unless otherwise indicated on the Website and communicated to the Customer at the checkout stage of the shopping cart before the Order is sent (e.g. in the event that a faster shipping method than the standard shipping method is available in the territory and can be selected by the Customer).</li>
        <li>5.2     ShoeSeller reserves the right to change the Price at any time, without prejudice to Orders already placed and Agreements already entered into. </li>
        <li>5.3     The payment methods for the Price and any costs for shipping available to the Customer are, depending on the country:</li>
        <li>(i)    credit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners, Discover, JCB and Union Pay);</li>
        <li>(ii)   Paypal, Apple Pay, Alipay (for mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan), Sofort (for Germany, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland), iDeal (for the Netherlands); and</li>
        <li>(iii)  Klarna (USA, UK, Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland).</li>
        <li>5.4     The payment service is operated by a third-party payment provider (different depending on the payment method that the Customer has selected). During the payment procedure, an additional payment authentication may be requested by the card issuer or banking institution (inter alia “Verified by Visa”, “MasterCard Secure Code”). Under no circumstances can ShoeSeller be held liable for payment errors through the third-party payment service occurring due to lack of connection or for direct and/or indirect damages that the Customer may suffer for any reason or cause as a result and as a consequence of suspensions or interruptions in the operation of the bank’s website (including any cyberattacks).</li>
        <li>5.5     ShoeSeller will perform, through the third-party payment service provider, a standard pre-authorisation on the payment method the Customer has selected. If, for any reason (for example, relating to inadequate/insufficient payment details provided by the Customer), it is not possible to charge the Price, the purchase process will be automatically cancelled and the Order will not be sent to ShoeSeller. Due to the failure to enter into the Agreement, ShoeSeller will have no delivery obligation towards the Customer, nor may the Customer claim payment of any indemnity and/or compensation for damages.</li>
        <li>5.6     The invoice or, more generally, the tax document relating to the purchase of the Products and the provision of services is sent by email to the Customer by Farfetch (and, specifically, by the Dutch company Farfetch Europe Trading B.V, VAT registration number IE3721596NH, for purchases of Products located within the territory of the European Union at the time of the sale, or by Farfetch UK Limited, VAT registration number GB 204 0769 35, for purchases of Products located within the territory of the United Kingdom at the time of the sale), which manages the payment and invoicing service on behalf of ShoeSeller. For VAT purposes, Articles 14(2)(c) and 28 (if applicable) of Directive 2006/112/EC apply for the territory of the European Union, and Section 47 (if applicable) of the VAT Act 1994 applies for the territory of the United Kingdom. The billing method does not affect the Agreement entered into with ShoeSeller or the related rights guaranteed to consumers by applicable law. Once issued, the invoice/tax document can no longer be modified.</li>
        <li>5.7     By means of the option “pay in 3 instalments without interest”, Klarna (Swedish payment service provider, “Klarna”) provides for the possibility of deferring the payment of the Price in three equal instalments. Payments for each instalment will be automatically charged to the Customer with the payment method selected by the Customer. The first instalment is charged to the Customer at the time the Order is placed in accordance with Article 4.6; the second and third instalments are charged 30 (thirty) and 60 (sixty) days later, respectively (unless otherwise indicated on the Website by Klarna). More information on the terms and conditions for using the payment instalment service offered by Klarna can be found here</li>

        <li>6.1     The purchased Products are delivered to the Customer by shipment to the delivery address indicated by the Customer in the Order.</li>
        <li>6.2     Shipping costs and times depend on the type of shipment selected by the Customer during the purchase process and indicated in the Order. The types of shipping available vary from area to area. Specifically, in certain areas the Customer may choose between standard and express shipping (where available), as better described on the Website on the shopping cart checkout page. More information on delivery costs and times can be found here.</li>
        <li>6.3     The Parties agree that the delivery times indicated on the Website are purely indicative and that in any event delivery will be made within 30 (thirty) days from the conclusion of the Agreement. After receiving Shipment Confirmation, the Customer can monitor the status of the shipment from the reserved area on the Website and/or the courier’s website with the shipment tracking number provided in the Shipment Confirmation. </li>
        <li>6.4     Upon delivery of the Products by the courier, the Customer (or a representative or other person indicated by the Customer) must verify: (i) that the recipient’s details on the delivery receipt are correct; and (ii) the integrity of the packaging and seals.</li>
        <li>6.5     Any damage to the packaging, seals that have been altered in any way and/or discrepancies with respect to the recipient’s references or documentation must be immediately indicated in writing on the courier’s delivery receipt (signature subject to inspection). </li>

    <h2> 8. CUSTOMIZATION AND PRE-ORDERS</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="section8" class="content">
        <ol>
            <li>8.1     For some items, ShoeSeller offers the possibility of: </li>
            <li>(i)    customising products (e.g. by affixing monograms to garments and accessories); and/or </li>
            <li>(ii)   pre-ordering products not yet in stock.</li>
            <li>8.2     When using the customisation service, the Customer can choose how to customise the Product by selecting customisations from the options made available by ShoeSeller. Customisation is therefore subject to the limits predetermined by the Company; ShoeSeller will not accept customisation requests beyond these limits.</li>
            <li>8.3     The customisation chosen by the Customer on the Website is saved for the duration of the current session only; ShoeSeller does not save any unfinished customisation sessions. Therefore, if a session is interrupted before the Order is sent, the Customer will have to start a new session to customise the product.</li>
            <li>8.4     Products that are not yet available in stock and/or in ShoeSeller stores can be previewed and pre-ordered on the Website. Pre-ordering consists of booking the purchase of products being produced and/or being delivered to the warehouse. </li>
            <li>Preview Products can be pre-ordered according to the purchase procedure and methods described in Article 4(the “Pre-order”). After a Pre-Order has been sent,ShoeSeller will monitor the availability of the pre-ordered Product and - as soon as the pre-ordered Product is available - send the Customer a notification containing details of the shipping and delivery schedule for the pre-ordered Product (the “Pre-Order Confirmation”). The shipping and delivery terms referred to in Article 6 commence when the Pre-Order Confirmation is sent.</li>
            <li>The Price of the pre-ordered Product is charged to the Customer after the Pre-order is sent through the payment method selected by the Customer. Therefore, by clicking on “pay now” the Customer expressly acknowledges and accepts the payment obligation.</li>
            <li>8.5     If a pre-ordered Product turns out to be unavailable due to impossibility to produce it, to deliver it in stock and/or for other commercial reasons, ShoeSeller shall promptly contact the Customer at the contact details provided by the same and refund the full Price paid by the Customer without undue delay.</li>

    <div id="section9" class="content">
        <ol>
            <li>9.1     Products purchased through the Website are covered by the legal warranty of conformity pursuant to Article 128 and following articles of the Consumer Code (the “Warranty”).</li>
            <li>9.2     Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4.2, ShoeSeller shall deliver to the Customer Products that are in conformity with the Agreement. In case of defective Products and/or Products that do not conform to the promised characteristics, the Customer must notify ShoeSeller promptly by filling in the relevant form (available here). This notification is not necessary only in cases where ShoeSeller has acknowledged the existence of the defect in writing or has concealed it.</li>
            <li>9.3     Unless proven otherwise, non-conformities materialising within 12 (twelve) months from the delivery date of the Product are assumed as existing since that date, unless the assumption is incompatible with the nature of the goods or with the nature of the non-conformity.</li>
            <li>9.4     The Warranty is valid for 2 (two) years from the Product delivery date.</li>
            <li>9.5     If ShoeSeller finds that a Product is defective or that there is a non-conformity, the Customer is entitled to have the Product brought into conformity by requesting, free of charge, that the Product be repaired or replaced, unless the remedy requested is objectively impossible or prohibitively expensive (taking into account the value of the goods and the extent of the defect).ShoeSeller shall repair or replace the defective Product within a reasonable period of time after the Company has been informed of the conformity defect.</li>
            <li>9.6     In cases where repair or replacement of the Product is impossible or excessively onerous, the Customer may request an appropriate reduction of the Price or termination of the Agreement (except in cases of minor non-conformity).</li>
            <li>9.7     It is understood that the Customer is not entitled to exercise the Warranty in the following cases:</li>
            <li>(i)    in the absence of proof of purchase;</li>

            <li>(i)    the Products must be returned in their original packaging, with their original package and labelling (including boxes, accessories, tags, labels and dust bags); </li>

            <li>11.8  It is understood that the right of withdrawal also applies to Products purchased on sale or during fire sales or other promotional periods. </li>
            <li>11.9  The right of withdrawal is excluded for tailor made or otherwise customised Products referred to in Article 8, pursuant to Article 59(c) of the Consumer Code. </li>
