        <div id="faq1" class="toggle_content">
            <p>PSD2 is a new European law introduced to make online payments more secure. It will impact customers in the European Economic Area (EEA) and customers using EU bank accounts. When you place an order online using a card payment, your bank may ask you to confirm your identity through 3D Secure authentication.</p>
            <h3>What are the payment steps when I place an order?</h3>
            <p>When you place an order in Singapore, you may be directed to a 3D Secure authentication by your bank. There are many ways to authenticate online payments and you could be asked to confirm your identity through SMS, email, or TouchID. Once your payment is authenticated and the order has been placed, you’ll return to the confirmation page. As soon as your order has been confirmed, you’ll receive an email.</p>
            <h3>How will my bank confirm my identity?</h3>
            <p>Get in contact with your bank to understand their 3D Secure authentication process. Make sure they have the correct contact details for you just in case they use SMS or email for authentication.</p>
            <h3>If I'm unable to place an order, what should I do?</h3>
            <p>If something didn't go quite right, you may contact our <a href="/index.php?url=information/contactus">Customer Service</a> team.</p>
            <h3>I have some more questions about payment: who should I contact?</h3>
            <p>Our <a href="/index.php?url=information/contactus">Customer Service</a> Advisors are happy to answer any additional questions you may have.</p>

            <p>A pre-order is the reservation of an item that is not yet available for sale but will be soon. Pre-order items are shipped upon the arrival of the products in the warehouse within the time that is stated on the item’s purchase page.</p>
            <p>In pre-order purchases, credit cards are debited at the moment the order is placed. Regarding order with available items and pre-orderable items, shipment will happen in 2 different phases: available merchandise will be shipped with standard shipping methods. Pre-orderable items will be shipped right after items are available in stock.</p>

            <p>After the authorisation, a transaction can still fail. If the transaction fails after authorisation the funds will still be reserved on your bank account. Although they have not been debited, they may appear to have been collected. Please note that after authorisation the reserve can last up to 30 working days before it is lifted. This may change depending on banks and credit providers.  </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The reasons for such failure may simply be:</li>
                <li>- The card limit has been reached</li>
                <li>- The card information entered is wrong</li>
                <li>- The card reached the maximum number of charges allowed in a period</li>
                <li>- The billing address does not match with the cardholder details</li>
                <li>- The card does not allow international transactions</li>
                <li>- The card does not allow online transactions</li>
                <li>- Depending on the country in which you are located you might have to call your bank to authorize your credit card for online, cross-border or overseas transactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In other cases, the reasons are less obvious and may relate to the ever-increasing fraud prevention and other security measures implemented by credit card companies to protect the cardholder against card abuse.</p>
