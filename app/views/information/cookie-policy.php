                This Website uses the following cookies:
                a) Technical Cookies
                The Technical Cookies allow the Website to function correctly, making possible for you to view its content
                in the related language and market as from your first visit. They are able to recognize the country you are
                connecting from and to ensure that, on each visit, you are automatically re-directed to the version of the
                    Website applicable for your country.
                    They also make possible for you to create an account, to log in and to manage orders.
                    If you are a registered user, thanks to the Technical Cookies the Website will be able to recognise you when
                    accessing the services offered to registered users only.
                    Technical Cookies are able to tell if you purchase products on the Website through an affiliated or partner
                    site, making possible for us to fulfil our obligations in relation to such partner sites.
                    Technical Cookies are strictly necessary for the functioning of the Website.
                    b) Analytical Cookies
                    The Analytical Cookies are used to create statistical analyses on the way users navigate on the Website
                    (e.g. the device they used, the number of pages they visited or the number of clicks on a particular page
                    they made during navigation).
                    Their purpose is to improve Website functions.
                    The results of the analysis arising from the use of Analytical Cookies are processed in an anonymous way and
                    for statistics purposes only.
                    In the event that they only allow the tracking of anonymous IP addresses (with a portion of the code that is
                    not visible), they are assimilated to Technical Cookies as they do not allow any users’ identification.
                    c) Profiling cookies
                    The Website uses Profiling Cookies, through which it registers preferences and habits detected during each
                    users’ visit and thus create profiles, allowing us to send you messages more in line with your preferences
                    and interests (e.g. allowing you to view the products you are looking for more quickly, or to offer you the
                    most similar items).
                    Profiling Cookies are used by trusted third parties, that make possible for us to display banner ads on
                    other affiliate sites (so called “retargeting”), showing the products that you have recently viewed. While
                    you browse the Website, Profiling Cookies are also used to display other products that may be of your
                    interest, or products similar to the ones that you have just watched based on your browsing schedule.
